# Tindev-Frontend

# Omnistack Week # 8 | Rocketseat
 - Developing an application using *Node.js*, *ReactJS* e *React Native*
 - Application Backend can be found <a href="https://github.com/gabrielsestrem/tindev-Backend-NodeJS">here</a>
 - Application Frontend can be found <a href="https://github.com/gabrielsestrem/tindev-Frontend-ReactJS">here</a>

## The App
 - The application to be developed will be similar to Tinder, but for developers;
 - Developers will be registered through Github, as users;
 - Data returned from a request made to the Github API will be saved to the database (MongoDB);
 - It will be possible to like and dislike the users;
 
 - Due to the **Node** architecture, through a **websocket**, communication will be made between the server and the frontend in real time;
 
## Day 2
 - Using **express**, a microframework that deals with routes, requests, and responses;
 - Using **nodemon** to monitor code changes and automatically restart the server when changes occur;
 - Creating *Models* and *Controllers*;
 - Using **mongoose** (ODM that uses Javascript syntax) to handle **MongoDB**, a nonrelational database;
 - Using **axios** to handle external API requests.

## Day 4
  - Using **socket.io**,  a library that abstracts from Node's standard websocket protocol and provides an easier way to work with it.
